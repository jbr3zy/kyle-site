                             <p>It is very difficult to start at the beginning. Loosely, we will define "visionary" as the phenomenon of human experience that radically departs from daily perception attuned to biological and societal survival.<br><br>
                             "Visionary" is not a wholly adequate term as it has become associated with all manner of tenuously genuine pseudo-systems of belief that tend to draw popular appeal from elements of accelerated self-help or facile salvation. Despite what baggage the modern popular imagination has linked to the visionary&mdash;in no small part due to movements like the late-19th century theosophists and mid-20th century psychonauts&mdash;this forum rejects that visionary experience is or should be associated with vapid mysticism or non-empirical leaps of faith.<br><br>
                             If the popular imagination has had such a corrupting influence on our conception of the isionary, why creat a public website fostering the populus to discuss and delineate it? Why not leave it to the handful of professional intellectuals versed in the esoterism? The visionary experience proper, if such a thing can be proved to exist, has never been the majority condition of a society. Nor has a culture been entirely devoid of it. It is consistently a fringe phenomenon; but that may not be its necessary condition. If more individuals in a society could participate in collaborative efforts towards a genuine visionary experience of liberated perception, the human condition would be better for it.</p>

                             <ul>
                                 <li>Have you ever experienced something that you think was a visionary experience? Can you express it in narrative prose, poetry, drawing, music, etc?</li>
                                 <li>How do issues of identity affect an individuals capacity for visionary experience? Is physical safety, a sort of Maslovian stability, prerequisite for visionary experience? Issues of identity include ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, political ideology, etc.</li>
                                 <li>Are there different cardinalities of visionary experience? That is to say, is each true visionary experience of equal magnitude, or can it occur in varying degrees? Similarly, is visionary experience only passively experienced, or can it be actively induced?</li>
