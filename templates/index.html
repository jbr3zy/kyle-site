              <p>This website is an attempt at answering a question as old as humanity&mdash;it may even prove to define humanity. The question can be phrased many ways: why do we suffer? why aren't we all happy? why don't we know what life is about? For this attempted answer, the key lies in what has been generally referred to as "visionary experience." Despite the terminology used, please note that the philosophy being developed here is largely secular and often critical of religions. That being said, "Would to God that all the Lord's people were prophets," (Numbers 11.29) aptly describes the sentiment here sought after. Why aren't we in a natural state of vision and prophecy? Biological, sociological, and technological pressures have become powerful inhibitors, but they are not necessarily so. In their ideal forms they can be used to alleviate the unecessary pressures of life and allow people to lead sustained lives of liberated perception.<br><br>
                <b>By hosting creative work, organizing events, connecting like-minded people and (hopefully one day) providing financial and material support to associated projects, we aim to be a catalysing force in pushing our society in a direction that will allow the greatest number of people to lead the fullest and freest lives possible.</b><br><br>
                What can you do now? Submit work and ideas: creative writing, poetry, painting, essays, music, thoughts scribbled on napkins. We want any work that pushes the boundaries of ordinary perception, describes or circumscribes the visionary, makes us say "wow," and gives us pause.</p>

              <p>Visitors of this site should note well that although we make use of terms like "beatific vision," this site is looking to develop a highly rational and critical philosophy, which makes no claims to follow any religion. However, within the paradigm of Western culture, it is beneficial to make use of and appropriate certain established terms in order to facilitate understanding. In order to define the line we percieve between the academic appropriate of certain terminology, and the artless, wholesale misappropriation of various philosophies in mad attempts to create meaning, we offer the following examples.  Though they may use similar aesthetics and rhetorical strategies as this site, they are actually profoundly at odds with our reasoning:<br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Link to a site.</li>
                    <li>link to a site.</li>
                    <li>etc...</li>
                </ul><br><br>
              If you found any of those sites divinely inspiring, you may find this site skeptical and curmudgeonly. If you enjoyed the earnestness, aesthetic and general philosophical attitude of those sites, but still remain highly skeptical of them, welcome home.</p>
