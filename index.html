        <p>This website was built to undo itself.  It seeks to explore as-yet-unsolved problems of human perception. More specifically, it intends to host a dialogue that investigates how to make what might be called a state of contentedness (not to be confused with "happiness") more fully and durably a part of everyday consciousness, despite external circumstance.</p>

        <p>Human contentedness is not a positive state but a neutral state, which is corrupted by the burden of biological survival. This corruption is compounded by societal survival as it has generally existed in our history, though society (as well as biological existence) is not an intrinsically corrupting phenomenon. Perceptual corruption is tempered and eliminated through the liberation of perception, a process facilitated by experience with otherness. Otherness is best made manifest through art, science and philosophy, though these subjects can have equal powers of obfuscation as illumination.</p>

        <p>If you have read this far, or even just skipped ahead to this tab, thank you. Simply put: post writing, paintings, music, essays, theorems, proofs, whatever, to this website, discuss them honestly and frankly, and try to connect with the people you feel you share something in common with. If you're feeling bold and want to make a real change in your life, get together in person. Share ideas and remind each other that moments of despair and feelings of meaninglessness are shared by everyone and only fleeting. At its best, society can act to undo the burdens of biological survival, and help us free perceptual bounds.  We can make such a society for ourselves. When we do, we will no longer need this website, it will have undone itself.</p>
